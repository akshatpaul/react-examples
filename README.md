# react-examples #

react-examples is a project containing simple react js & react native examples which help you learn various concepts of react. This is a active repository and examples are updated frequently (rather whenever I get chance to build some examples). Following is the list of examples I have created so far :

## 1. React js server side ##
This example helps you use react js for server side rendering. To understand more you can read this post and use the source - [Server side with React](http://techleap.blogspot.in/2015/08/server-side-with-react.html)

## 2. WebView Shell with React native ##
This example helps you create a shell to load any url in webview with React native. You can directly use this code for your project. To understand more you can read this post and use the source [Webview with React native](http://techleap.blogspot.in/2015/07/webview-with-react-native.html)

## 3. ToDo app with Reflux & react native ##
reflux is gaining lot of traction in react js world as an alternate to flux pattern. In this example we have used Reflux with React native to create a todo application.
